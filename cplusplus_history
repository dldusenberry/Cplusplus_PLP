# C++ History

1.	What is the name of your language?
    	a. C++
2.	When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?
    a.	The C++ programming language was created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1985. C++ was initially released as an extension of the C programming language and later in 1998, the C++ programming language was standardized.
    b.	Stroustrup’s motivation for creating C++ was to enhance the C language with high-level features for large software development with performance, efficiency, and flexibility in mind. Initially, Stroustrup’s work was developed as an extension of the C language called “C with classes” that allowed for object-oriented programming. 
3.	What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: websites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.
    a.	C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages for system software development, including operating systems, web browsers, video games, databases, machine learning, distributed systems, various applications, etc. 
    b.	C++ is used in most of the software from Microsoft such as Windows, VisualStudio, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Office. Most Adobe applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator are also written in C++. Additional examples include Mozilla Firefox and MySQL. 
4.	Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.
    a.	I will likely get most of the information from the wonderful World Wide Web. Finding information from various online tutorials, forums, GitHub, free courses, and formal documentation available. I also plan to either purchase or download for free one or more books to keep, so that I may reference them in the future. Honestly, the amount of free information available on C++ is endless.
